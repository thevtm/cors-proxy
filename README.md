# CORS Proxy

A simple [cors](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/) proxy I made using [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) for one of my projects.

Feel free to use/fork it.

It's very limited and only supports GET requests.

## Usage

### Server
```
git clone 
npm install
npm start
```

### Requests

```
curl http://localhost:3000/http://swapi.co/api/
```
